# rpmconf

tool to handle rpmnew and rpmsave files

What it does:
- run "rpmconf --help" and you will see :)
- it searches all config file of all installed packages and check if file with .rpmsave or .rpmnew exists.
- It allows you to see diff of this file against current file and can do merge.
- It allows you to keep current version or the other one (rpmsave or rpmnew one).
- it deletes .rpmsave and .rpmnew files which are identical to current file
- after your choice it deletes the unwanted file.
- it can search for all orphaned rpmsave and rpmnew files.
- it can dump diffs for unattended automation.

I provide only .zip and .tar.gz (automagically generated by GitHub) and .src.rpm.
If you are looking for .rpm files run either:
  dnf install rpmconf
- at least in Fedora and EPEL - or check:

If you just want to see the difference between old and new files,
run rpmconf non-interactively like this (for one package):

    [user@host ~]$ rpmconf -oglibc -D

## How to build package

    yum install tito
    cd source
    tito build --rpm

## Hacking

    commit your code (localy is fine)
    cd source
    tito build --test --rpm

## Packaging status

## History

Originally there was no such tool for RPM world. I came from Debian world where handling
of configuration files is directly in apt. Since rpm is non-interactive, such handling
must be in separate tool. Therefore I started creating rpmconf, which is very similar
to Debian configuration handling. I even try to copy as much as possible the frontend
strings and formatting as I hope that sysadmins appreciate unified UI in Debian and Fedora.
